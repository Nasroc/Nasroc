### Hello There Everybody!

My name is Carson Benedetto and I am learning to develop games.

I am currently working on creating a replica of the free Idle/Incremental game Egg Inc.

I wanted to challenge myself and learn in a new exciting way so I decided to pick a game I enjoy playing
and trying to recreate it with my own code.


If you have any tips I can use on my journey feel free to get in touch with me!
